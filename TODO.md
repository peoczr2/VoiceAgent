    -Events are a big mess, has to be finished, proper parsing, nested fields handling, structure events better in the sense put the events in seperate files based on which emits it. Better connect events, in the sense that grouping them or like multiple type of event can essentially be AudioEvent, so come up with my own event types, etc. Maybe its good to have a BaseEvent, with type, publisher_id or name, etc
    Event typing and routing
    Create a BaseEvent with common fields (type, publisher, timestamp). Explicit types can subclass this base. Centralizing event definitions will help each service know exactly what to expect. It also enables runtime validation in Service.publish() and Service.handle(), reducing errors.

    - Lifecycle Management
        You already have start_all() which gathers the run() tasks for all services. Adding a matching stop_all() that cancels tasks and waits for them to finish would let the network shut down cleanly (similar to how LangGraph manages node lifecycle). Having a ServiceLifecycleEvent dataclass (lines 7‑11 in service.py) hints at this capability.
    
    -  Middleware / Interceptors
        Consider hooks that intercept events as they flow through the network—for logging, metrics, or retry logic. This would let you extend functionality without modifying individual services.
    
    - Distributed or Remote Services
        If services begin to run on different machines, you could replace the in‑memory queues with a transport layer (e.g., WebSockets or an async message broker) while keeping the same publish/subscribe abstraction.


    - Dynamic Topology Changes
        Right now connections are set up before start_all(). Allowing services to subscribe/unsubscribe at runtime would make the system more flexible, especially if services appear or disappear.



    - Graph‑Level Operations
        Since to_nx_graph() already builds a NetworkX representation, you could extend this to compute metrics such as degree centrality, detect unreachable services, or visualize the live topology.
