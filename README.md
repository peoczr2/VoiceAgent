# VoiceAgent Browser Prototype

This repository contains an early prototype of a cross-platform desktop browser built with **pywebview**. It allows loading arbitrary web pages inside an embedded view and sends highlighted text back to Python.

## Requirements

Install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Start the application with:

```bash
python browser.py
```

An address bar will appear where you can enter URLs. Selection of text inside the page will be printed to the console.
